This project contains the implementation of the Minesweeper game using three different frontend frameworks (Next.js, Vue.js, and Svelte) and a backend built with Express.js. The project was created as part of the ITU (User Interface Programming) course for the 2024/2025 academic year.

- shared:   Shared TypeScript types for frontend and backend.  
- backend:  Backend of the application implemented in Express.js.  
- frontend: Contains implementations for each frontend framework:  
  - nextjs: Frontend implemented in 'Next.js' - Marek Čupr (xcuprm01).
